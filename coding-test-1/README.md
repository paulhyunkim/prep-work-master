# Coding Challenge I: Prepwork

Below we list some prepwork to complete before taking the first coding
challenge. If you're new to coding, the prepwork is meant to introduce
you to the fundamentals of writing a computer program. After you've
prepared, try out the example problems (and check the solutions!)
before beginning the coding challenge.
