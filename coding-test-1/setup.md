# Setup

## Avoid the hassle?

You can use [repl.it](http://repl.it) and avoid any setup of Ruby for
the first coding challenge. Longer term, you will want to install Ruby
on your computer. If you're ready to do that, read on!

## Ruby 

[About.com's Ruby installation page][about-ruby-install] has
instructions on how to install Ruby for Mac, Windows and Linux.

## Code Editor

You need a proper code editor; notepad or TextEdit won't cut
it. Because we work in pairs, it's important that everyone use the
same text editor. Please use [Textmate 2][textmate-github] (download
[here][textmate-download]).

Textmate is Mac only; Windows users can use [Sublime][sublime].

## Terminal

A lot of Ruby development is done at the command line. Mac users can
use Terminal.app.

Windows users can run `cmd`, which is the Windows command line. Run it
by pressing `Windows Key-R` (launches "run program") and typing `cmd`
into the box.
